#  Raspberry Pi CPU Usage Stream
This simple node script first reads through the RPi system to get the CPU usage.

## Setting Up

Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

`npm install` or `yarn install`

This script requires an ethereum private key. You should create a `.env` file in the root directory and add this line:

`ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY=`

Paste your private key after the equals sign.

## Running

Use `npm run start` or `yarn start` to run node script.
